This assignment will test your knowledge of machine learning, data visualisation, and computer vision techniques in Python. This will primarily focus on scikit-learn, seaborn/matplotlib and skimage/opencv, and how to program using these packages and as such you should use the appropriate functionality provided by the packages. You may also use Numpy, panda, etc. where appropriate for some questions. Do not use any other external packages other than these.

In the below questions you will generally need to complete the code in the cell below the question and output the required results, charts or graphs.
